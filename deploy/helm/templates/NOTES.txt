Welcome to Runtime-Class-Manager {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}.

Next steps:

Create one or more Wasm Shim custom resources. See the samples in https://github.com/spinframework/runtime-class-manager/tree/{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}/config/samples.

> Note: The sample Shim manifests include `platforms` entries for both `x86_64` and `aarch64`. The controller automatically selects the correct artifact for each node's architecture.

For example, install the Spin shim:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinframework/runtime-class-manager/refs/heads/{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}/config/samples/sample_shim_spin.yaml
```

Next, annotate one or more nodes with a label corresponding to the `nodeSelector` declared in the Shim, runtime-class-manager will install the shim as well as create the corresponding RuntimeClass:

```shell
kubectl label node --all spin=true
```

You are now ready to deploy your Wasm workloads.
